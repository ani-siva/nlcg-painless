# NLCG-Painless

Based on Jonathan Shewchuk's original manual : https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~quake-papers/painless-conjugate-gradient.pdf

Includes numerical methods for

* Quadratic Form
* Steepest Descent
* Method of Conjugate Directions
* Preconditioned Conjugate Gradient
* Preconditoned Nonlinear Conjugate Gradient

All stored in the **libraries** folder. Including a library for basic matrix operations.

## NOTE: 
The makefiles are sloppy and the code is far from optimized. Will implement them sometime later.
